							 I’m interesting in deigning and make video games. Since I was a kid I’ve got my first PSP and I have lots of happiness with it.  My favorite video game on PSP is MonsterHunter I was immerse in the fantasy of fighting against monster then I got my first XBOX and PlayStation 4 and play various video games when I was alone. The video games that inspire me were DarkSouls series, the huge background and special way of the telling story attract my attention, the difficulty of DarkSouls series are really high and it taught me a lot of lessons. I would like to be a video game maker like Hidetaka Miyazaki ( the maker of the DarkSouls series) and let people remember my video games.

						<div class="entry">
							 I’ve been to Melbourne for several times and RMIT has one of the best designed teaching building in all the modern universities. I chose to study in RMIT not just because it have a beautiful buildings but also it is one of the best university for study computer science. On another hand, I’ve heard that RMIT got the best deign course in Australia and maybe I can learn some deigning knowledge to help me make my own video games.

						<h2 class="TITILE"><a href="#">What I hope to learn in RMIT</a></h2>
						<div class="entry">
							During the studying in RMIT, I expect to learn various programming skills to adapt the changing IT world, for example, C++, Java and Python. Also in university I want to train my self-study skills which will help me a lot after graduate from university. Because I’m a foreigner in Australia and it will be a chance for me to practice my oral English and learn local cultures.

					 <h2 class="TITILE"><a href="#">Ideal Job in the Future</a></h2>
						<div class="entry">
							I said that I would like to be a video game maker so after graduating from university it is better to go to video game studios to learn some skills. I think I would like to be hired by a video game studio rather than own and run a studio because own a studio at the beginning will have poor fame, support and high chance of failure. After I own some fame and support I will open up my own video game studio. I would like to be the designer and programmer of the video game, I’ve got several thoughts in my head now for video games. The programming skills will make these thoughts become true. My drawing skills are awful and it is not a right job for me to do the modeling. 
  I’ve made a new friend in RMIT last year, He is a student who study art of video games and we planed that to make a small video game by ourselves in this summer break. I think I can get familiar with making video games after these training and gain some fame if our video games success.
